# Scottish Devolution Tracker Thingy

This is a little static site which I'm using to track events and other
interesting things which relate to the new powers being devolved to Scotland
after the independence referendum of 2014.

If you fork this site, or want to submit a pull request, the simplest way to
add new items to the timeline is by editing `_data/vows.yml`. This yaml file
is used when generating the static HTML for the website. It's format is fairly
straightforward - the entries which are already there should be enough to use
as templates. Every item should always have at least one source which can be
linked to.
